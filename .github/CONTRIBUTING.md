## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/pradeesh-kumar/go-raft-kv).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/pradeesh-kumar/go-raft-kv/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/pradeesh-kumar/go-raft-kv/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/pradeesh-kumar/go-raft-kv) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/pradeesh-kumar/go-raft-kv/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.
